HOC, class lifecycle methods

1. What is React?
React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces, 
especially for single-page applications.

2. What are the major features of React?
The major features of React are:

It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
Supports server-side rendering.
Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

3. What is JSX?
JSX giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

4. State - 
class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      message: 'Welcome to React world'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

5. Mounting Lifecycle Methods
React supports three mounting lifecycle methods for component classes: componentWillMount(), render(), and componentDidMount(). 
componentWillMount() will be called first followed by the render() method and finally the componentDidMount() method.
